## Text-based RPG

Its a single-player text-based RPG, coded in C++.

## Story

It takes place in the Medevial eras. You go into a unknown cave with your friends, you find a mysterious note and a crate full of jewelry. But before you can leave the darkness swallows you and your friends, you get seperated from them and end up in a labyrinth. You have to get out of there by doing quests and defeating the final boss.

(ChatGPT was used during the process of writing the story.)

## Game Mechanics / Usage

Its fairly self-explanatory, you have choices between 1-(however amount).

It will tell you the cordinate at the top and you have to explore the labyrinth by going north (up), south (down), west (left) or east (right).

Every time you move there is a chance of a goblin appearing. There are specials rooms like the teleporter, healing pool and 5 different loot rooms, quest rooms, side character rooms, mini boss rooms and finally a final boss room.

## Purpose (why this project was made)

We were simply bored and wanted to learn more about the C++ language

## Known issues

Spamming can cause loop issues, to fix just restart the game. But it does not include a saving feature so you have to start again. So just dont spam the options.
